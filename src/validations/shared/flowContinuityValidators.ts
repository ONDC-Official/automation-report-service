// "this call" against "the flow so far". These checks are protocol-level (true for every
// ONDC beckn domain by definition of the beckn context object), so they're written once here
// and wired into checkPayload.ts for every domain, not duplicated per domain.
//
// `priorPayloadsInFlow` is everything already processed for this flow, in chronological order,
// BEFORE the current element. It does not include the current element itself.

// 2026-08-25 addition: order-trail-vs-ON_SEARCH, quote.id cross-call consistency, and quote
// arithmetic. Requested explicitly — "trail maintain honi chahiye sabhi calls ke liye from
// on_search to all calls", "quote id sabhi me match hona chahiye calculation sahi honi chahiye",
// "ho sake inko common bnao sabhi domains ke liye". Same rationale as above: written once,
// runs for every domain that has an ON_SEARCH catalog / a quote, no per-domain wiring needed.

 * actionDataService.ts, called from validations/ONDC:FIS12/2.2.1/select.ts) — which also had a
 * bug: it treated `onSearch.providers` as a single object when building the item/fulfillment
 * universe (`onSearch?.providers?.items`), even though it correctly handled `providers` as an
 * array for the provider-id check two lines above. On a real multi-provider catalog (`providers`
 * is always an array per the beckn schema), that made `onSearchItemIds`/`onSearchFulfillmentIds`
 * come back empty, so every real select would report ALL its items/fulfillments as "missing in
 * ON_SEARCH" — a false failure, not a missed check. Fixed here by building a proper
 * per-provider Map. `select.ts`'s call to the old buggy helper was removed in favor of this.
 *
 * Runs for every action that carries a `message.order` (select, init, confirm, update, and
 * their on_* echoes) and every domain — ON_SEARCH itself and `search` (which has
 * `message.intent`, not `message.order`) are naturally exempt since neither has an order to
